"""
Worker Scheduler — Multi-Agent Intersection Coordination
========================================================

Sits outside all AgentNodes and coordinates their Workers at shared
intersections. Each Worker registers its intended turn with the
Scheduler before executing, and the Scheduler returns a go/wait
signal based on conflict analysis and RVO velocity constraints.

Architecture:
    WorkerScheduler (one per simulation)
    ├── Maintains an intent registry: {agent_id -> IntentRecord}
    ├── Detects conflicts: overlapping paths through intersection
    ├── Computes RVO velocity constraints for trajectory spacing
    └── Returns go_signal in {0.0, 1.0} per agent per step

Conflict Detection:
    Two agents conflict if they're at the same intersection AND their
    intended paths cross. The conflict matrix is defined per intersection
    in the graph JSON (or computed from exit headings).

    Simple version (Phase 1): Priority by arrival order. First agent to
    register at an intersection gets GO, later agents get WAIT until
    the first clears.

    RVO version (Phase 2): Agents approaching with conflicting paths
    receive velocity constraints that keep their trajectories separated
    by a minimum time gap.

Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO):
    Standard RVO computes a velocity-space constraint for each agent
    pair such that, if both agents respect their half of the avoidance,
    collision is guaranteed impossible. For intersection coordination:

    - We compute the time-to-intersection (TTI) for each agent
    - If two agents' TTIs overlap within a safety margin, the later
      one receives go_signal = 0 (WAIT)
    - The safety margin accounts for vehicle length, braking distance,
      and sim-to-real timing jitter

    This is simpler than full continuous RVO because intersections have
    discrete conflict points (the crossing zone), not continuous
    obstacle boundaries. We only need to ensure temporal separation
    at the crossing, not spatial avoidance along arbitrary paths.

Dependencies:
    - numpy
    - agent/intersection_graph.py (TurnCommand)

# Conflict Rules

# Which turn pairs conflict at a standard 4-way intersection?
# Two agents conflict if their paths through the intersection cross.
# This is conservative: if in doubt, mark as conflicting.
#
# Key: (approach_A_relative, turn_A, approach_B_relative, turn_B) -> bool
# "approach_X_relative" is the relative direction the other agent comes
# from (opposite, left, right). Same-direction approaches never conflict
# because agents are in the same lane.
#
# Rather than enumerate all combinations, we use a simpler rule:
# Two agents at the same intersection conflict UNLESS they are:
#   1. Both going straight from opposite directions (no crossing)
#   2. Both turning right (paths don't cross in right-hand traffic)
#
# Everything else is conservatively treated as conflicting.
