"""
Agent Node - Hierarchical Driver-Worker Architecture
====================================================

Each vehicle in the simulation is managed by one AgentNode, which contains two internal nodes that
run at different levels of abstraction.

AgentNode
|-- Worker (Route Planner - WHERE to go)
|   |-- Reads position from PhysX (training) / EKF (deployment)
|   |-- Consults IntersectionGraph for available exits
|   |-- Selects turn command (LEFT / STRAIGHT / RIGHT)
|   |-- Registers intent with external WorkerScheduler
|   |-- Receives go/wait signal from Scheduler
|
|-- Main (Vehicle Driver - HOW to get there
    |-- Receives camera image + telemetry vector
    | (Worker's turn_token in vec[0], go_signal in vec[1])
    |-- OUTER loop: direction decision (from turn_token)
    |-- INNER loop: go/brake decision (visual scene + go_signal)
    |-- Outputs [steer, throttle, brake] to vehicle actuators

Execution flow (every env.step()):
    1. Worker.step(position, heading, speed)
       -> queries graph, picks turn, talks to scheduler
       -> returns (turn_token, go_signal)

    2. turn_token and go_signal are injected into obs["vec"][0:2]

    3. Main.step(obs, policy)
       -> policy forward pass with enriched observation
       -> OUTER: turn_token conditions kinematic anchors
       -> INNER: go_signal gates throttle/brake
       -> returns action [steer, throttle, brake]

    4. action applied to vehicle

The Worker and Scheduler are classical (non-learned) planners. The Main uses the learned CNN+LSTM+PPO policy.
This seperation means that the policy never has to learn route planning, it only learns visual-motor control
conditioned on discrete navigation intent.

Telemetry Vector COntract (updated from experiment.py):
    vec[0] = turn_token {-1, 0, 1} from Worker (was turn_bias)
    vec[1] = go_signal {0.0, 1.0} from Scheduler (was reserved/0)
    vec [2..11] unchanged - speed, yaw_rate, last action, PVP zeros

Training Modes for Worker:
    "route": Follow pre-defined route (list of turn commands)
    "random": Sample uniformely from available exits
    "curriculum": Weighted sampling, straight-biased early, uniform late

Dependencies:
    agent/intersection_graph (IntersectionGraph, TurnCommand)
    agent/worker_scheduler.py
    numpy

    Vehicle driver node inside an Agent.

    The Main node doesn't own the policy, the policy lives in SB3's

    1. Inject Worker's commands into the observation before the policy
       sees it (turn_token -> vec[0], go_signal -> vec[1])

    2. Post-process the policy's raw action output with the go/brake
       inner loop: if go_signal == 0 (Scheduler says wait), override
       throttle to 0 and apply brake regardless of what the policy
       wants. This is a safety layer, not learned behavior.

    The nested loop structure is:
        OUTER: Worker decides direction -> turn_token conditions anchors
        INNER: Scheduler + visual scene -> go or brake
            - Scheduler go_signal == 0 -> hard brake (safety override)
            - Scheduler go_signal == 1 -> policy controls throttle/brake
              (policy still sees go_signal in vec[1] so it can learn
               to anticipate stops, but the override catches failures)

    This means:
        - The policy LEARNS to stop when go_signal is 0 (from experience)
        - The safety override GUARANTEES it stops (even if policy ignores)
        - Over training, the policy's behavior converges with the override

        If the Scheduler says WAIT (go_signal == 0), we override the
        policy's throttle/brake output to force a stop. This is the
        hard safety layer, the policy also sees go_signal and should
        learn to stop on its own, but this catches policy failures.

        If go_signal == 1 (GO), the policy's action passes through
        unchanged, the policy owns throttle/brake decisions during
        normal driving.

        Args:
            action: [steer, throttle, brake] from policy.
            go_signal: 0.0 = WAIT, 1.0 = GO.

    Top-level agent containing Worker and Main nodes.

    One AgentNode per vehicle. The environment creates AgentNodes and
    calls agent.step() each timestep, threading position data to the
    Worker and observation data to the Main.

    Integration with IsaacDirectEnv:
        The env calls:
            1. agent.worker_step(pos, heading, speed, dt, scheduler)
               -> gets (turn_token, go_signal)
            2. agent.prepare_obs(raw_obs)
               -> injects token + signal into obs
            3. Policy runs on prepared obs -> raw_action
            4. agent.apply_action_gate(raw_action)
               -> applies go/brake safety override
            5. env applies gated action to vehicle

    Integration with training loop (train_policy_ros2.py):
        The AgentNode doesn't interfere with SB3's training loop.
        It wraps the observation before SB3 sees it and gates the
        action after SB3 produces it. From SB3's perspective, the
        observation space is unchanged (still Dict with image + vec),
        and the action space is unchanged (still Box [steer, thr, brk]).
        The Worker's decisions appear as part of the observation.
