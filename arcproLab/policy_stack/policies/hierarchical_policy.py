"""
Hierarchical Path Planning Policy for Isaac Sim

Two-stage architecture for vision-based autonomous driving:
    1. Planning Head: predicts waypoint deviations from kinematic anchors
    2. Control Head: converts planned waypoints into Ackermann commands

Architecture:
    FusionFeatureExtractor (CNN + Physics) -> 268-dim features
        -> LSTM Actor -> 256-dim latent
        -> LSTM Critic -> 256-dim latent (separate)

    Actor path:
        latent_pi -> MLP Extractor -> planning_head -> waypoint deviations
        kinematic_anchors(obs_vec) + deviations -> final waypoints
        cat(latent_pi, norm_waypoints) -> control_head -> action_net -> [steer, throttle, brake]

    Critic path:
        latent_vf -> MLP Extractor -> value_net -> V(s)

    The planning head predicts DEVIATIONS from kinematic anchor points, not absolute positions. This gives the network an
    inductive bias towards smooth curved paths while allowing learned corrections.

Kinematic Anchors:
    Dynamic curved paths computed from turn_token (discrete navigation command from Worker)
    blended with current steering for smooth transitions.
    turn_token values {-1, 0, 1} map to LEFT, STRAIGHT, RIGHT.

Key Design Decisions:
    - Waypoint normalization (/ WAYPOINT_NORM_SCALE) is centralized in _compute_control_features() to prevent the forward/evaluate_actions
      inconsistency bug that caused training instability.
    - Planning head final layer is initialized near-zero so the policy starts by following kinematic anchors (straight/curved) paths before
      learning corrections.
    - predict_values() receives lstm_states as a raw (h, c) tuple from SB3-contrib, NOT an RNNStates object. This is a known SB3-contrib
      convention that caused AttributeError in earlier versions.
    - get_distribution() handles both RNNStates and bare tuple formats for compatibility with different SB3-contrib call sites.

Dependencies:
    - policies/fusion_policy.py (FusionFeatureExtractor)
    - sb3_contrib (RecurrentPPO, RecurrentActorCriticPolicy)
    - stable_baselines3
    - PyTorch

Used by:
